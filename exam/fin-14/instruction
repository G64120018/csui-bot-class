IKO42360 Final Exam 2014:

===
PROBLEM 1

Goal: 
> to build an MC-based localization on a mobile robot working in a 2D planar workspace

Robot:
> dimensionless point robot
> a (non-holonomic) differential-drive robot
> eight equally-spaced sonars with some resolution and some maximum range, installed in the robot's perimeter.
> eight equally-spaced cameras capable of extracting a feature of a landmark, see the lecture note 3++: Velocity Motion and Feature-based Measurement Models

Workspace:
> a 2D planar world whose layout follows those of the Kontes Robot Cerdas Indonesia: wheeled division, see the directory of maps/
> size: 20x20 grids, grid resolution: 1 unit (meter), index begin at 0, y+ axis points downward

===
PROBLEM 2

Goal:
> implement (experiment on) planning under MDP on a simplistic grid map
> motive: to propose an inside-room navigation to our friends in Tim Robot UI, assuming that the robot has a sensor capable of inferring the position of the obstacle and the on-fire candle

Robot:
> dimensionless point robot
> a holonomic robot with 8 actions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W and NW
> the transition probability can be generalized from this observation:
>> for the desired action of N and the current grid x
>> arrive at adjacent grid of x in the north direction with the probability of 0.7 
>> arrive at adjacent grid of x in the north-west direction with the probability of 0.1 
>> arrive at adjacent grid of x in the north-east direction with the probability of 0.1 
>> arrive at adjacent grid of x in the east direction with the probability of 0.05
>> arrive at adjacent grid of x in the west direction with the probability of 0.05 
> if the robot hits the wall, it stays at the current state

Workspace:
> discrete grid world
> take the largest room from the map of Problem 1 _or_ build up your own
> determine one grid to put an on-fire candle, the goal states are the adjacent grids with the radius of one grid
> determine one grid for obtacle whose adjacent grids with the radius of one grid become deadly grids since the robot will be stuck forever once it steps in those grids

RULES

Teaming:
> the class is divided into 5 teams 
> one team is of 4 students at most

Evaluation:
> team score (w= 0.45): duration:  about 2 weeks
>>> code (w= 0.60): correctness, scalability, reusability, maintainability, documentation, ...
>>> technical report (w= 0.40): use the template, see: 
> individual score: w= 0.55, duration: one hour (at most) per team
>>> present your understanding and contribution to the report and the coding
>>> answer some (random) questions
