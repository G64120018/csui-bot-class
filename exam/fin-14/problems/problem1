PROBLEM 1 (for elaborated instructions, please refer to the rpt-sample)

Goal: 
> to build an MC-based localization on a mobile robot working in a 2D planar workspace

Robot:
> dimensionless point robot
> a (non-holonomic) differential-drive robot
> eight equally-spaced sonars with some resolution and some maximum range, installed in the robot's perimeter.
> eight equally-spaced cameras capable of extracting a feature of a landmark, see the lecture note 3++: Velocity Motion and Feature-based Measurement Models

Workspace:
> a 2D planar world whose layout follows those of the Kontes Robot Cerdas Indonesia: wheeled division, see the directory of maps/
> size: 20x20 grids, grid resolution: 1 unit (meter), index begin at 0, y+ axis points downward
