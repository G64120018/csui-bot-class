PROBLEM 2 (for elaborated instructions, please refer to the rpt-sample)

Goal:
> implement (experiment on) planning under MDP on a simplistic grid map
> motive: to propose an inside-room navigation to our friends in Tim Robot UI, assuming that the robot has a sensor capable of inferring the position of the obstacle and the on-fire candle

Robot:
> dimensionless point robot
> a holonomic robot with 8 actions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W and NW
> the transition probability can be generalized from this observation:
>> for the desired action of N and the current grid x
>> arrive at adjacent grid of x in the north direction with the probability of 0.7 
>> arrive at adjacent grid of x in the north-west direction with the probability of 0.1 
>> arrive at adjacent grid of x in the north-east direction with the probability of 0.1 
>> arrive at adjacent grid of x in the east direction with the probability of 0.05
>> arrive at adjacent grid of x in the west direction with the probability of 0.05 
> if the robot hits the wall, it stays at the current state

Workspace:
> discrete grid world
> take the largest room from the map of Problem 1 _or_ build up your own
> determine one grid to put an on-fire candle, the goal states are the adjacent grids with the radius of one grid
> determine one grid for obtacle whose adjacent grids with the radius of one grid become deadly grids since the robot will be stuck forever once it steps in those grids
