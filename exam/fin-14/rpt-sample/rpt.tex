\section{Introduction}
This report guidance is not strict in the sense that you may \emph{not only} add some point \emph{but also} remove some point, yet you still obtain an optimal grade (if those addition and removal are reasonably justified).
Feel free to ask TAs for any doubt.

\section{Related Work}
Discuss or review in-depth \emph{one} related work.
Each team is initially assigned different paper.
This can be changed to any paper of your choice; preferably it is published in major robotics conferences, such as ICRA, IROS, RSS.
For you, we have collected: \cite{1389783, 5354298, 5509950, 6696380, 6094843, 4059089}

    \item what is the problem that they tackled?
    \item how is the proposed solution/method?
    \item how good is their solution? any comparisons?
    \item what it the limitations of their work?
    \item what future work or open problems do they mention?
    \item your opinions about the work
\end{itemize}
